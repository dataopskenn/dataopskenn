After about three years of starting a new github page to get into data/analytics engineering from being a data analyst, I have decided to kick this new journey off, mind you finally, I am not exactly a rookie, I have experience in building robust end-to-end data workflows, pulling data from various sources, cleaning and processing them, storing them in databases, and pudhing them to Business Intelligence tools for data analysis reporting. This experience is the reason I am setting out to tackle the harder, more advanced tasks, utilizing a combination of sophisticated tools.
