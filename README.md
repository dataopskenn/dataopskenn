After almost one year (about 9 months) of starting a new github page with the aim of getting into data/analytics engineering from being a data analyst, I have decided to finally kick this new journey off, mind you, I am not exactly a rookie, I have experience in building robust end-to-end data workflows, pulling data from various sources, cleaning and processing them, storing them in databases, and pudhing them to Business Intelligence tools for data analysis reporting. This experience is the reason why I am setting out to do the harder, more advanced stuff, with a combination of more sophisticated tools.
